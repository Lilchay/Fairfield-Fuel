The collapsed scrolling style of the website makes it easy to navigate. The landing page is divided into two sections: "How It Works" and "Teams". The graphic displayed in the first section briefly outlines the components of the program. The "Teams" section displays the teams in two columns. The respective website and social media accounts are located underneath the team's picture. Once the user hovers over the picture of the group, a brief blurb about the team is shown.
