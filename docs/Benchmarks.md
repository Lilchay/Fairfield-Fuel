The ~Social Enterprise~ Competition then began, with the ~five~ finalists presenting their business plans to a panel of judges, who asked them several questions about their organizations and their plans for moving them into the future.


The Quinlan Social Enterprise Competition encourages an entrepreneurial spirit focused on the common good and allows participants to build new value and competitive advantage by addressing community needs through new business development. Social enterprises today must take into account not only profitability, but also the business’s impact on the environment and people in the society.

The competition provides participants with a venue to develop confidence and interdisciplinary skills relating to writing a complete business plan and executive summary. In addition, the top five business plans are chosen to present to judges who are successful investors and professionals serving in today’s business market. Cash prizes are awarded to the top three business plans to provide capital to take the team’s business idea and continue to move toward fruition.

Students that attract funding will be entered into the Summer Fellows program at the Fairfield University Entrepreneurship Laboratory (FUEL) where expert mentors will guide them through the process of launching their companies. The summer program will conclude with a second investor Showcase event where the startups can attract direct investment from local investors and alumni.
